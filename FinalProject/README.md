Diabetes Risk Prediction

Priya Tikoo

#### Executive summary
Diabetes is a chronic condition which is characterized by high blood sugar levels. Early detection of diabetes based on symptoms is very helpful in controlling the disease.Comparison of several ML models can help to identify individuals who are at risk of diabetes based on specific factors.By analyzing the symptoms/features and understanding their association or importance would help to identify and perform risk analysis between the features and diabetes.These features are used to tain and test several ML models in order to predict the occurrence of diabetes. 

#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?

Physicians now have the opportunity by virtue of using the ML techniques and models to assess the risk factors and provide adequate guidance and help with management and prevention of diabetes.
#### Research Question
What are you trying to answer?

Diabetes is a metabolic disease, involving inappropriately elevated blood glucose levels and with the modern lifestyle, incidence of diabetes is increasing. Aim of this project is how physicians can effectively predict and perform early diagnosis of diabetes.
#### Data Sources
What data will you use to answer you question?

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/early-diabetes-classification
#### Methodology
What methods are you using to answer the question?

1. Conducting Feature Analysis to perform feature ranking to identify their order of importance.
2. Compare several models to evaluate the most performant model so as to identify those individuals who are at the highest risk. (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree).The 10-fold cross-validation can be applied to test the effectiveness of different models.
3. Performance metrics such as AUC, Precision, Recall etc. can be used to evaluate the classifier 's performance.

#### Results
What did your research find?

Application of several ML models can help to identify individuals who are at risk and specifically data exploration through risk factor analysis could help to identify associations between the features and diabetes. Performance analysis could show the accurate models for diabetes detection.
#### Next steps
What suggestions do you have for next steps?

This work can be extended by using DL methods
